**Sconet** (our "*scon*es and tea budg*et*") is a simple little personal finance app that lets you record your income and expenses,
setup categories and budgets, and break down your spending, all in multiple currencies.

It's ðŸš§ **super WIP and incomplete** ðŸš§ so expect to find broken things everywhere - at the moment this is more of a testing ground for me to experiment with using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), creating a semi-custom GraphQL client etc, rather than something I recommend actually using!
